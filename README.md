- **Sentiment Analysis**: Learn how to interpret and classify customer feedback.
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Develop skills in preprocessing data for analysis.
- **Model Building & Visualization**: Gain experience in creating predictive models and visualizing results.
- **Effective Presentation**: Presenting findings and insights using PowerPoint. 🎤📊

### What You'll Do
- **Scrape Customer Feedback**: Gather and analyze data from third-party sources.
- **Analyze & Present Insights**: Use PowerPoint to showcase your findings and recommendations. 📝

## 🛠️ Task 1: Web Scraping & Sentiment Analysis

### Description
- **Web Scraping**: Utilized Python to scrape unstructured review data from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways). 🌐
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Processed and analyzed customer reviews to identify positive and negative sentiments. 😃😡
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned the data to ensure it was ready for insightful analysis.

### Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed unwanted non-alphabetic characters. 🚫🔠
2. **Tokenization**: Split the text into meaningful words. 🔍
3. **Stopwords Removal**: Filtered out common but less informative words. 🚫🗣️
4. **Lemmatization**: Normalized words to their base form for consistency. 🔄
